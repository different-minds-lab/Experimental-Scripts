              <h5>Consent Form</h5>

              <p>The purpose of this project is to examine the cognitive mechanisms that underly person perception. This experiment consists of 1 session lasting approximately 30 minutes in length. This study is being conducted by Dr. James Tanaka (University of Victoria), Anna Lawrance (University of Victoria), Katelyn Forner (McGill University), and Nicholas Argument (University of Victoria). If you have questions about this study, you may contact Dr. Tanaka by telephone (250-721-7541) or e-mail (jtanaka@uvic.ca) or Anna Lawrance (annalawrance@uvic.ca). 
              </p>
               
              <p>This research is important because it will generate knowledge that is fundamental to our understanding of face and body perception. 
              </p>
              <p><b>Risks and Benefits</b></p>
              <p>The risks involved in the study are minimal. Some observers may experience fatigue or eyestrain as a result of extended computer viewing, so it is recommended that you take advantage of scheduled breaks or rest when needed. You may find participation is beneficial and interesting as it may make you think about your own perceptual processes in different ways and give you insight into how psychological research is conducted.</p>

              <p><b>Compensation</b></p>
              <p>For your participation, you will receive SONA credit.</p>

              <h5>Consent Form cont.</h5>

              <p><b>Voluntary Participation</b></p>
              <p>Your participation is voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time without consequence and without having to provide an explanation. If you withdraw from the study, your data will be deleted. You may contact the experimenter if you have any questions. However, answers that may influence the experimental outcome may be deferred until the end of the entire experiment.</p>

              <p><b>Confidentiality and Anonymity</b></p>
              <p>Confidentiality and anonymity for participants is a primary concern for us and will be protected by storing related paper-based or electronic records in a locked filing cabinet in the laboratory of Dr. James Tanaka (Cornett A081). The data will not be disseminated publicly, except in summary form through professional journals or books or scholarly meetings. Data may be used in future research or shared with collaborating researchers, but will remain fully anonymous, with no identifying information. Data will be anonymized and stored electronically by the researchers indefinitely. Research publications and presentations from this study will not contain any information that could personally identify you. Should the data be shared publicly (e.g., via an online repository), the shared data  (i.e., the responses you provide on experiment trials) will contain only identification numbers.</p>

              <p><b>Dissemination of Results</b></p>
              <p>It is anticipated that the results of this study will be shared electronically via the internet and in print form and may appear in professional journals, books, and/or scholarly meetings. Under no circumstances will individual subjects be identified.</p>
               
              <p><b>Disposal of Data</b></p>
              <p>Electronic data from this study will be stored indefinitely. Consent forms will be deleted after five years.</p>

              <h5>Experimental Protocol</h5>

              <p>Considering this study is being conducted in-person, we would like to request that you follow the protocol listed below when completing this experiment.</p>
               <p><b>Please:</b></p>
               <p>1) <b>Avoid talking with your peers while completing the study.</b> If you have questions, please don't hesitate to raise your hand. The research assistant on site will be happy to help.</p>
               <p>2) <b>Do not listen to music or podcasts while completing this session.</b> If you find the noise of nearby keyboards distracting, we have disposable earplugs on site to drown out the noise!</p>
               <p>3) <b>Do not take photos</b> of the stimuli or trials that are displayed on screen. It is important to: 1) maintain the security of this experiment's materials and 2) maintain the confidentiality of other participants who are present.</p>
               <p>4) <b>Do not check your phone (unless it is an emergency). Even on breaks!</b></p>
              <p>5) <b>Do not eat or drink while completing trials.</b> You may take a sip of water, if needed, during your breaks.</p>
              <p>6) <b>Do your best! :)</b></p>

              <h5>Instructions.</h5>

              <p>The Face Body Perception task is looking to investigate the effects of the face on body perception and vice versa. You will be presented with 2 face and body composites sequentially and will then be asked to identify if the combinations you observed were the same or different.</p>
              <p>Each stimulus will be presented briefly, so we ask that responses be made as accurately and as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>
                By pressing the "Get Started" button to proceed to the experiment, you consent to participating in the experiment, and have fully read the instructions provided.
