# Different Minds Lab: Experimental Scripts Repository

## What is this repository?
This repository acts as a database / archive of all previously run experiments in the Different Minds Lab.

## Why does this repository exist?
1. **Resource:** All of these experimental materials act as an excellent resource for current and future lab members.
2. **Accountability:** When sharing code with collaborators, there is an expectation that code will be documented to a reasonable extent (e.g., comments included throughout scripts). This same expectation applies to adding code to this repository!
   - Some added benefits of this accountability measure include:
      1. If you end up returning to a project at a later date, you will be able to recall the experimental protocol you implemented.
      2. To meet this accountability criteria, you may end up being more strategic and clear in how you go about writing code, which may actually save you time! :)
3. **Helpful documentation when writing a manuscript:** Sometimes, the timeline from coding up an experiment, to collecting data, to analysing data, to finally writing up a manuscript can be quite lengthy! Considering this, having clear and concise documentation detailing how you went about things will be helpful to you and other members involved in the research.

## What is NOT included in this repository?
- Participant data (participant data is not to be stored on GitHub)
- Analysis scripts
- Results

## What IS included in this repository?
- **Arguably most importantly:** A ReadMe file to orient lab members to the repository. This ReadMe file should detail the general procedures of the experiment: stages of the experiment, tasks completed by participants, and general trial constraints used.
- All content needed to run the experiment that was conducted in the lab.
- Examples of content that meet these criteria are included below for reference:
   - Stimuli
   - jsPsych plugins called throughout the experiment
   - JavaScript files used to run the experiment
   - Supporting HTML and CSS scripts
